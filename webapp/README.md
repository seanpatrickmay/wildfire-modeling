# Webapp

Simple local visualization for GOFER-style JSON time series.

## How to use

1) Open webapp/index.html in a browser.
2) Load a JSON file produced by gofer_confidence_to_json.py or firms_viirs_to_json.py.
3) Use the slider to move through time steps.

The webapp renders each time step as a heatmap on a canvas and displays basic metadata.
